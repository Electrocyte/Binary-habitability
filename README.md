Binary stars pose difficulties for habitable planets. They reduce the possibilities for stable orbits,
and complicated calculations of the circumstellar habitable zone. This is a repository designed to help
worldbuilders calculate the effective surface temperature of a planet in a binary star system. It lets
the user pick the spectral types of each star, as well as the separation between the two.

Spectral type data comes from [Eric Mamajek's models](http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt)
